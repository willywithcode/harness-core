# Product Docs

This directory contains current consumer-product behavior derived from real
accepted intent. Harness deliberately ships no fake product domains.

When a user provides a product specification, derive smaller living documents
here instead of keeping one growing specification as the operating manual. Name
files after actual product domains, such as `overview.md`, `billing.md`,
`permissions.md`, or `api-conventions.md`.

## Current Product Contract

No consumer-specific product contract is shipped in this generic directory.
`harness-core`'s own contract lives in its root README, `docs/WORKFLOW.md`,
lasting decisions, implementation, and executable tests.

## Update Rule

When behavior changes:

1. Update the affected product document when the expected behavior changed.
2. Update the active execution plan when complex work uses one.
3. Add a lasting decision only when future work must inherit a consequential
   product, architecture, data, security, compatibility, or validation choice.
4. Add or update executable proof that exercises the behavior.

Bounded changes do not require a parallel lifecycle record.
